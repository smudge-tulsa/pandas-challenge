TCC data analysis Pandas challenge

This repo contains the deliverables for my submission for the TCC DA bootcamp Pandas challenge. The challenge was to use Python and Pandas libraries to analyze & present findings relative to a public school district's budget & student performance, such as which schools' students performed better than others and determine if there is a correlation between fund allocation (budget) and student performance.

The codebase is a Jupyter Notebook under PyCitySchools:
PyCitySchools/PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb

The Resources subfolder contains the original raw data in CSV format.
